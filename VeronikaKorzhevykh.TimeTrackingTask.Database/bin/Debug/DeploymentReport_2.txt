       The type for column Id in table [dbo].[Projects] is currently  INT IDENTITY (1, 1) NOT NULL but is being changed to 
         UNIQUEIDENTIFIER NOT NULL. There is no implicit or explicit conversion.
       The column [dbo].[WorkTimes].[EmployeeId] is being dropped, data loss could occur.
       The column [dbo].[WorkTimes].[UserId] on table [dbo].[WorkTimes] must be added, but the column has no default value and

         either: add a default value to the column, mark it as allowing NULL values, or enable the generation of smart-defaults
         as a deployment option.
